# Here's an example of what I like to do:
#
# cat file |
#   grep thing |
#   grep other_thing |
#   cat > output_file
#
# This is just an example, often it's other commands besides greps. This is nice
# because it's easy to add or remove greps as conditions arise. This is
# technically less efficient than replacing `cat file` with `< file`, but it's
# more readable to more people, so I think it's worth it.
