* Emacs Package Management Setup
** Add Melpa as a package repo
Melpa is the big package repo that nearly /everything/ can be
found. It's a must for emacs configs.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
#+END_SRC

** Make sure use-package is installed
use-package handles automatically installing and loading packages as they're referenced
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'use-package))
#+END_SRC
** use-package should always try to install missing packages
It makes the first load really slow, but it removes the need to think about anything.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+END_SRC


* Core Setup
** Basic Stuff
*** Better Defaults Package
Contains many near-universal config improvements. NOTE: It does override some keybindings that we'll want to re-bind later.
https://github.com/technomancy/better-defaults
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package better-defaults
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC
*** Default screen should be scratch buffer
Remove splash screen and use *scratch* instead as the home buffer
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq inhibit-startup-message t
      inhibit-startup-echo-area-message t)
#+END_SRC

*** Emacs Backup Files Go In Tmp
Funnel all the auto backup files to one location.
Despite years of reading that Emacs tmp files will save my bacon one day, it has yet to happen. They can all hang out in tmp.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq backup-directory-alist '(("." . "/tmp")))
#+END_SRC

*** Line numbers should always be on
Switch line numbers on by default in all buffers
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-linum-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

*** Disable Menu Bar
Switch the Menubar off by default. I have never used it.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(menu-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

*** Disable Scroll Bar
Remove Scroll Bars
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

*** Disable Tool Bar
Remove Tool Bars
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

*** Disable visual bell
# TODO - this doesn't seem to disable the bell anymore
The visual bell shows up on your screen as a yellow triangle with an exclamation mark in it.
I don't need to see it. I already know I'm mashing ctrl-g more than necessary.
#+BEGIN_SRC 
  (setq visible-bell nil)
  (setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)
#+END_SRC
*** Show tool tips in echo area
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(tooltip-mode -1)
(setq tooltip-use-echo-area t)
#+END_SRC

*** Smooth Scrolling
Smooth Scrolling 
#TODO this is not as smooth as I would have hoped.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package smooth-scroll
    :ensure t)
#+END_SRC
*** Command is Meta Key on OSX
#+BEGIN_SRC  emacs-lisp
  (setq mac-option-key-is-meta nil)
  (setq mac-command-key-is-meta t)
  (setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)
  (setq mac-option-modifier nil)
#+END_SRC

*** Enable deleting selected text
By default, text under the region won't be deleted if you type or paste. I find this infuriating.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (delete-selection-mode 1)
#+END_SRC
*** Start Emacs server
I use this to make sure git commits are written in my main emacs instance instead of starting another.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (server-start)
#+END_SRC
** Themes
*** Load manual install theme dir
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")
#+END_SRC
*** Install Themes from Repos
List of themes to install
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package monokai-alt-theme
    :ensure t
    :defer t)
  (use-package gruvbox-theme
    :ensure t
    :defer t)
  (use-package darkokai-theme
    :ensure t
    :defer t)
  (use-package darktooth-theme
    :ensure t
    :defer t)
  (use-package creamsody-theme
    :ensure t
    :defer t)
  (use-package github-theme
    :ensure t
    :defer t)
  (use-package melancholy-theme
    :ensure t
    :defer t)
  (use-package darkburn-theme
    :ensure t
    :defer t)
  (use-package kaolin-themes
    :ensure t
    :defer t)
  (use-package dracula-theme
    :ensure t
    :defer t)
  (use-package darkokai-theme
    :ensure t
    :defer t)
(use-package monokai-alt-theme
    :ensure t
    :defer t)
#+END_SRC

*** Load Current default theme
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (load-theme 'monokai-alt t)
#+END_SRC

** Fonts
# TODO - get a better default font - inconsolata, maybe?
Set default font
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (set-default-font "Monospace-16")
#+END_SRC


* TODOs
** smooth scrolling could be smoother; looks like it still jumps quite a bit


# javasceript
# (setq js-indent-level 2)

# whitespace
# ;;(setq tab-width 4)

# ;; Death To Autofill
# (auto-fill-mode -1)
# (remove-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
