# New Computer Setup
If you've got a blank MacOS install and want things set up the Expected Behavior way, run

    script/setup_computer

This operation should be idempotent, though it may be a bit time consuming.

# Installing Only The Dotfiles
If you've already got your computer set up and just want the dotfiles

    script/setup_dotfiles
